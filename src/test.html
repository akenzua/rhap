        <span class=\"v0_8_2\"><sup id=\"Gen.8.2\" class=\"v0_8_2\">2</sup>the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained; </span>

        <span class=\"v0_8_3\"><sup id=\"Gen.8.3\" class=\"v0_8_3\">3</sup>and the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated. </span>

        <span class=\"v0_8_4\"><sup id=\"Gen.8.4\" class=\"v0_8_4\">4</sup>And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. </span>

        <span class=\"v0_8_5\"><sup id=\"Gen.8.5\" class=\"v0_8_5\">5</sup>And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth <span class=\"add\">month</span>, on the first <span class=\"add\">day</span> of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.</span></p>\n

        <span class=\"v0_8_9\"><sup id=\"Gen.8.9\" class=\"v0_8_9\">9</sup>but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters <span class=\"add\">were</span> on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark. </span>
        <span class=\"v0_8_10\"><sup id=\"Gen.8.10\" class=\"v0_8_10\">10</sup>And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; </span>

        <span class=\"v0_8_11\"><sup id=\"Gen.8.11\" class=\"v0_8_11\">11</sup>and the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth <span class=\"add\">was</span> an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth. </span>
